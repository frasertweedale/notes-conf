Stupid stuff I used to believe about stories:

- stories are a way to document requirements in an agile process
- good stories are small
- good backlogs are built out of prioritised lists of stories
- each story we build is valuable to customers and users

Documents don't work the way you think they do.

- specifying in writing doesn't work well
  - cakewrecks.com (literally interpreted instructions)
- nasa mars climate orbiter (imperial/metric mismatch)
- stop it.  stop exchanging documents.  tell me your story.
- the original idea of a story was simple: use it to facilitate a
  conversation.
  - use stories as basis of *conversation* to discover details of what
    needs to be built
  - stories get their name from *how we use them*, not how we write
    them.
  - backlog grooming is not the conversation Kent Beck had in mind.
- with a shallow discussion, we may all take away something
  different
- when we *externalise* our thinking with words and pictures, we
  detect differences.
- shared understanding is the objective of collaborative work.
- to build shared understanding, use sketching and recording on
  walls and whiteboards
- *use words and pictures*
- what you record during conversations works like a vacation photo
  - looking at it helps you remember details that aren't in the
    photo
- summary
  - effective story conversations build shared understanding
  - the best documents use words and pictures to help recall our
    conversations, they don't replace conversations.


You'll have to think things through.

- so you want to build something?  what happens *after* you build
  it?
- your job in software development is not to build stuff; it is to
  *change the world*
- output: the faster you deliver crap the more crap you get.
- products you like: do you like them because they were shipped on
  time?
- outcome: measure in how users change their *behaviour*
- impact: benefits to company because of positive *outcomes*
- your job:
  - minimise output (build less, not more)
  - maximise outcome and impact

- "requirement" should mean "good ideas that solve user problems"
  - it usually means "shut up"
- stories are an antidote to "requirements"
- you can deliver a fraction of what users ask for and still make
  them happy
- you can deliver *everything* they ask for and they might still be
  unhappy.
- talk about who does what, and why.

Story anatomy:

- good, short title
- who want thing
- what do they want
- why do they want it?
- it's a *conversation starter*

Story life cycle:

- card
- conversation
- confirmation
- if you replace a conversation with a document, you've stopped
  using stories

It's easy to get nowhere fast.

- a story map helps organise dicussion about users' experience with
  our product.
- frame the idea (why build the product?)
- understand users (what are their goals?)
- map use (from the user's perspective)
- explore details:
  - smaller steps
  - alternative steps
  - UI details
  - technical details
- a story map is a simple way to tell a story and break it down into
  parts
- build story maps in small collaborative groups
- use the map for continuous discussion
- summary:
  - Use story maps to understand your whole product or feature's
    experience
  - use maping to break down big stories without losing the big
    picture
  - plan by slicing the map into holistic, valuable releases


- MVP: can *only* be relative to a particular target
  customer/outcome/impact.
- Smallest product you could build that reaches your target
  outcomes.
- *not* the crappies thing that could possibly work.
- Prioritise *outcomes*, not features.
- delivering your hypothetical solution a piece at a time delays
  learning.
  - if your outcome is "enjoy driving", anything less than a whole
    car will not achieve it.
  - a *smaller* hypothesis might be delivering a skateboard to a
    smaller group.  iterate to scooter, bicycle, motorbike.
  - you have to *search* for "minimum" and "viable".

Summary:

1. Tell stories, don't just write them
2. Use simple visualisations to anchor the stories you tell
3. Tell the whole story to find the parts that matter most
4. Think things through; minimize output, maximise outcome and
   impact
5. build to minimum viable proudct.
