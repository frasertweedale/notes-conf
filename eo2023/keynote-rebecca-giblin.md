# Keynote

- Prof Rebecca Giblin, University of Melbourne


- Chokepoint Capitalism - the idea was born during a cab ride

- We refused to accept the false dichotomy of big tech vs big
  content, where you pick the giant whose crumbs fall from the table

  - Better to envisage a world without the giants

- COVID.  Found with spare capacity?  What is the story I want to
  tell?
  - How big tech has captured creative labour markets
  - A thought: "You know what would be better? If Cory Doctorow
    wrote this book with me."  I wrote to him and he agreed.  That
    is a thing you can do.

- All the big tech are using the same playbook.

- An egregious story that illustrates the playbook: Audible
  - Audible is the dominant audiobook supplier in Anglosphere
  - No questions asked returns policy, return for new credit
  - Amazon really pushed this policy.
  - Customers started treating their audible libraries like
    libraries; borrow and then return
  - What they didn't realise was that Audible clawed back the
    royalties.
  - This was part of a bigger scam.
  - Authors started noticing that something weird was going on with
    their sales and returns.
  - Audible refused to report to authors on returns and sales.  Only
    net sales.
  - Oct 2020, a reporting glitch.  3 weeks of returns data came up
    in a single day.  Hundreds or thousands of returns.  The veil
    was lifted.
  - How did Audible do this in the first place?
  - Amazon is the master of this playbook.

- Amazon's "flywheel"
  - lock in customers.  cement customers to audible and kindle, and
    through free delivery
  - lock in suppliers, because all the customers are at Amazon
  - "low cost" really means "shaking down suppliers"
  - competition is eliminated
  - force workers and suppliers to accept unfairly low prices
  - low prices reinforce the customer acquisition and lock-in.

- "Competition is for losers" - Peter Thiel
  - Competition is supposed to be fundamental to capitalism
  - But there has been a concerted effort by big players to eradicate 
    competition and scorch the earth
  - VCs will not enter the kill zone of Amazon and other giants

- The chokepoints are caused not just by monopolies, but also
  *monopsonies*
  - Accessible example from AU is the supermarket duopology.
    Suppliers have almost no bargaining power.  The buyers can set
    the prices.
  - Find ways to squeeze your workers and suppliers
  - Monopsonies are far more dangerous for workers and monopolies

Affected industries include:

- music streaming
- physical books
- ebooks
- online video
- audiobooks
- hollywood scripts
- event ticketing
- mobile apps
- live music
- news ad markets

"Enshittification"

- What always happens when monopsonies chokepoint a market
- Attract users → suppliers have to be there
- Make it easy for suppliers to reach customers
- Advertisers come on board
- You see less of what you care about (why you were there in the
  first place), and more ads
- Make the experience as bad as you can, just above the threshold
  where users bail
- We're seeing it play out with Twitter now
- Name it, call out enshittification when you see it.

What can we do about it?

- Require transparency

- Require interoperability
  - Or establish adversarial interoperability
  - We need more than rights to bypass restrictions.  We need
    positive rights.

- Equity
  - Open Access promotes equity regardless of social (dis)advantage.
  - creator clawback, e.g. "out of print" clauses

- Stewardship
  - distinct from ownership (which is still important)
  - how to protect and preserve works for the future
  - "who's got what, and who needs what?" for sustainable continuity

- Self-determination
  - Big tech work to deprive us of it
  - One size never fits all, in any category
  - "Competition isn't about making the market efficient.  It isn't
    even about choice.  It's about self-determination."—Doctorow
  - Caveat: humans are not very good at determining what makes a
    good life.

- Collectivity
  - Even the most atomised and powerless people can, by working
    together, flip the tables
  - e.g. Uber drives contractually locked into commercial
    arbitration.  So thousands of drivers commenced arbitration.

How do we start?  It feels like such a big project.

- "You wouldn't start from here."  But we have to.
- Build connection and community.
- Extractive capitalism is designed to isolate us and make us feel
  empty.  We will fill the whole with ever more consumption.
- Let's eat the elephant.
