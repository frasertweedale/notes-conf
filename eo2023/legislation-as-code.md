# Creating open source legislation as code (for a more open society)

- I have a dream that gov policy is built in a way that is
  *Accountable, participatory, humane adaptive, accessible*

- Pia Andrews

- Policy is like the OS for a society

- People measure policy outcomes looking for the things they
  expected, not the unexpected/unintended consequences.

- There is a big gap between policy and delivery.

- If you don't have multidisciplinry teams with diverse experience,
  skills and perspectives, chances are it will miss the mark and
  have unintended consequences.

- Policy options and futures are continuously being raised and
  explored, not just in gov but from the public also.
  - Why can't we file a bug report?
 
- Changing things starts with reimagining "good"

- Human-readable only leads to myriad interpretations and
  implementations by different orgs for different purposes, often
  without policy assurance.
  - Compliance (sometimes) which is manual and partially targeted

- Enablers for a better pathway
  - Continuous monitoring of human impact indicators (broad and
    policy-targeted)
  - Public engagement tools to explore and test options and
    modelling of impact
    - Good example, Taiwan Uber kickoff
  - The right to an explanation (e.g. s23 OAI, NZ) for citizens to
    exercise.
  - **Policy as code**
  - **Policy test suite**

- Pia's origin story: AUSTRAC (Australian Transaction Reports and
  Analysis Centre)

- Problem #1: We need **better rules** that can be more easily
  implemented, modeled, reformed holistically.
  - The traditional way does not work well and is not scalable.

- ... (missed)

- Problem #3: shaping society and economy is no longer simply about
  shaping human behaviour.

- Problem #5: disincentives / perverse incentives
  - e.g. AUSTRAC incentives were around detecting and prosecuting
    abuse, whereas the purpose is to strengthen the system to
    prevent abuse in the first place.

- ... (missed)

- Problem #7: policy impact
  - improving the human impact of public policy.

## Rules as code

- What rules?
  - Prescriptive ones: thresholds, conditions, elegibility criteria
  - Fits well in social policy, tax, 
  - *not* judgment-based rules

- What RaC is not:
  - structured content (e.g. XML) that would still require
    interpretation, codifying and hardcoding efforts
  - automated law
  - traditional rules engine
  - interpretation or translation engines (e.g. tools to convert
    prose into code)
  - AI
  - a website

- Step 1 for codifying:
  - understand it.  read the legislation.
  - concept modelling (what are the objects, relationships, etc).
    Good for finding use cases, test cases.
  - "isomorphic drafting" - deliverable is prose *and* accompanying
    code

- openfisca - tool for whole-population policy impact modelling

- Demos of some NZ public services / tools implemented using RaC
  artifacts

- Policy difference engines:
  - Proposed change X â†’ here are all the people that will be better
    or worse off.

- There is a lot to explore.

- Digital legilation and regulation
  - arguably a precondition for lawful AI in gov, but also for
    public trust
  - transparency, traceability, accountability, auditing, and
    appealability of gov decisions and decision processes.

- Human services need human participation and accountability

- Participatory government must become our norm

- Epiphanies
  - rules and business logic need an amicable separation
  - leg/reg is part of digital public infra we need
    - there are a lot of snake oil salespeople (as always)
    - there is also a strong coalition of the willing
  - anything short of `api.legilation.gov.au` is not enough.

- Most major tax departments around the world do a micro version of
  RoC.

- Identify inter-discipline friction as a thing, and build
  multi-discipline teams, recognising that the better outcomes come
  *because of the diversity*.

## Questions

- Examples of other (non-gov) orgs using RoC artifacts?
  - Example from NZ
