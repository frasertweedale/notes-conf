# Open, agile, hybrid and distributed

- Donna Benjamin, Red Hat (Open Innovation Labs)

We live in revolutionary times

- don't think of the kind where people lose their heads
- think scientific, technological revolution


**Agile**

- about driving forward, continual movement
- "open doors, rather than selling keys"

**Hybrid**

- "Open Hybrid Cloud"
- Not necessarily innately good quality, e.g. biological hybrids
  that cannot reproduce

**Distributed**

- Bad alternatives: "remote" (isolating), "virtual" (as if you're
  not real?)

- It is the "new normal"


"Literally changed everything"

- Really?
- besides, not all change is good.
- "new tech bingo"
- "algorithms of oppression"
- "algorithmic siege on our humanity"
  - sounds hyperbolic.  but e.g. see Robodebt.

Leaving with a question:

- "How might we continue to pursue **positive**, open and
  **inclusive** change?"
