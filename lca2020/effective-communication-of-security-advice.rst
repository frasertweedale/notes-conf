Tools and ideas to help communicate security advice.

It's super easy for tech/sec professionals to get stuck in our
"bubble".  We are a tiny island.  But everyone deserves security.

Alas not everyone gets security.

- 0days, XSS, lack of 2FA, old OSen, pwd reuse

- "too hard"  we focus on the people doing the "right" things, and
  refuse to help those doing the "wrong" things (e.g. still using
  WinXP).

- in not helping these people, we are giving up on the vast majority
  of users of the internet.  Our aunts and uncles, grandparents,
  CEOs(!), etc.

- People do try to make the best decisions they can with the info
  they have.

- What if people aren't bad at security because it's hard, but
  because we aren't engaging with them about what good security
  practice is.

- Zoom out of the bubble. People don't think about security.  They
  get used to a lack of security and privacy, and accept it.

1. who are these people?
2. What advice should we give them?
3. How do we communicate it?

Security persona anaysis shows two main categories:

Group One: people who don't know (or are confused) about good
security

"...No one can hack my mind": Comparing expert and non-expert
security beliefs.

Group Two: knows about good security practice, but don't do any of
it (yet)

- time investment, sunk cost (password memorisation)


"Which program do I need to install to be secure" - interviewee 6.

Security is like exercise:

- always room for improvement (incremental)
  - baby steps; you can't go from couch to marathon
  - so, "2FA all the things" is a big leap.  Password manager might
    be better next step.  "perfect is enemy of the good"

- personalised
  - three sliders
    - tech capability/comfort;
      - lean on the familiar ; customisation vs new tools
    - privacy needs
      - "I am in hiding" -> "I need to be visible"
      - "Be a minimalist" -> "Obfuscate (remove metadata/scheduling)"
    - likely adversaries
      - script kiddies -> nation state
      - if you're a defector, get professional advice.

  - where do you sit?  Where do your friends/families sit?
  - See Open Internet Tools Project

- habitual and ongoing
  - lay a path for progression
  - "Couch to 5k" for security


HOW to communicate
------------------

- "tell, sell and shame" does not work

- just telling someone what to do is not enough
  - "reactance theory" - telling someone what to do harms their
    feeling of autonomy and control
  - antidote: lead by example
    - "this is how I do X"

- selling doesn't work
  - 9 times out of 10 people know what they "should" be doing
  - smoking in Arabic communities
    - the social situations were a big deal; was polite for host to
      offer cigarette, and rude for guest to decline.
    - most successful compaign was soap opera style ads were guest
      politely declined the cigarette, making it more socially
      acceptable

- shame culture

  - laugh at people posting their credit card on twitter, getting
    tricked to divulge password, etc.  "Windows XP" is a punchline.

  - shame culture means people don't ask for advice

  - to combat: treat mistakes as learning opportunity

- Influencers
  - Could it be that YouTube is the perfect platform for
    communicating security advice?
  - YouTube + full time work is hard!

- To reach and connect with people requires vulnerability

- The people who have the best security practice are the same people
  who don't want to tell others about it

- BE HONEST ABOUT HOW HARD IT WAS

- BE VULNERABLE

- People want (and need) to hear that they're not stupid for finding
  it hard
