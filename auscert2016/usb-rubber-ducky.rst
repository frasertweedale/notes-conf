USB rubber ducky:

- programmable USB device, uses HID, types stuff real fast
- ``\\<ipaddr>`` - mount SMB share, authenticated as active user

- when inherent trusts baked into system for sake of convenience, it
  only takes the right lie to break the system
  - but this is the stuff that makes grandma's life easier!


Wifi open network w/ captive portal:

- modern OSes trust remembered networks
  - automatically open the default page
- violate this trust with Wifi Pineapple!


USB-ethernet adapters:

- with SoCs, embedded linux, remote access and MitM capabilities
- *LAN Turtle* (because getting shells is fun)
- as long as it's powered over USB, you've got remote access to the
  network.
- client does DHCP?  hand out bad DNS servers
- all it takes is a little lie

- We have grandma to thank for this
  - computers need to be easy / play & play
- We live in culture of convenience
  - we will trade almost anything for convenience:
    - money, quality, security
- security is hard
  - PGP is not convenient
  - keybase.io/darrenkitchen
- is grandma onto something?
- is convenience actually a curse, or can it be our salvation?
  - whatsapp: e2e encryption for a billion users, without them even
    knowing or caring
  - iMessage, facetime etc.
  - let's encrypt
- where security meets convenience, things get really interesting
- if security is convenient, or default, we'll live in culture of
  convenience **and security**
