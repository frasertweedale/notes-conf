Overview:

- Electronic systems increasingly critically involved in health care
  delivery.

- Medical devices are networked.

- In AU: 97% GPs use electric records

- Consumers are more engaged with their health.
  - patients can view own records / notes
  - keep an eye on records of family / people they care for
  - fitbit, etc
    - many more data sources than previously
  - social media, sharing of health data
- **health information is distributed**
  - we want to "join the dots"
  - a lot of the information is confidential
- health care "teams"
  - GP + specialist + dietician + ... need access to specific data
- clinicians need access to data *at the point of care*
- analytics
  - moving from treatment to prevention
  - more tailored treatment
  - "non-episodic" care

Cyber risks:

- breaches of health care record
- 89% healthcare orgs breached in last two years
- one in three US citizens have had health care records breached
- volume and variety of data makes health care ind. more vulnerable
- medical record worth 10x to crackers than credit card
- consequences
  - info used to buy equipment/drugs and onsell
  - medicare fraud
  - currently takes much longer to detect than credit card fraud
- ransomware: disruption to care delivery
- hacktivism:
  - Anonymous targets Boston Children's Hospital after high-profile
    child custody case
- patient harm
  - control of insecure wireless devices
  - demonstrated examples: insulin devices, pacemakers
  - harm through destruction or manipulation of medical records

Sociotechnical considerations for securing health information:

- multiple stakeholders distributed in space and time
- diverse user needs and task requirements
- high availability requirement for data
- data access must not:
  - impede clinical work
  - endanger patient safety
- IT system maturity is highly variable
- security is (sadly) not usually a priority in system design,
  implementation and use
