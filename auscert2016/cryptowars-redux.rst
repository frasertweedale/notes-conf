- IETF and RFCs (DNSSEC, DANE)
- key escrow, Clipper, Slipjack
- *eligible doorbell*
- rapid growth of cryptology in research and education
  - ECC
- crypto business (RSA, Atalla, RanData, ERACOM, etc)
- crypto chips/co-processors
- COCOM arrangement becomes Wassenaar Arrangement
  - export of "dual use" military/civilian equipment
- Australia's *Walsh Report* on "policy relating to encryption
  technologies"
  - The most famous example of how nerds and wonks can together get
    things totally mixed up
  - You can get it on EFA website

2000..2020

- decryption capability for defence, intel, law enforcement
- data retention
- export restrictions (AU DECO/DTCA)
- IETF/IAB and "trust" in Internet globally
- crypto weapons / nation state, socio-political and criminal
- open source crypto for enthusiast, hobbyist, hacker
- cipher standards (RSA, ECC, AES etc) and hardware (TPM)
- MOOCs / open crypto education and training
  - Stanford Crypto on coursera
- "nerds" vs policy "wonks" vs "defence" interests

2020..

- international widespread competence in algos, impl, integration, use
- everyone codes on cheap hardware
- crypto weapons in cyberspace / CNI
- enter China, India, South America, etc
- ICT "colonisation"
  - Australia, NZ, etc; we use it but we don't make it
- Quantum computing / crypto
  - IBM (5-qubit online)
- Impact on policy / legislation

Today and tomorrow

- World leaders saying daft things
- NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence recommends
  against backdoors
- High security is now the norm
- China: new anti-terrorism law requires tech firms to help decrypt
  information
- US universities get "F" for cybersecurity education
  - AU unis... "G"?
- Meanwhile in Chinese universities / institutes:
  - Lattice Cryptography, homomorphic encryption
  - ECC new algos
  - Quantum Cryptography

Conclusions:

- nerds vs wonks vs protectors ; clash of cultures


Open Questionss:

- can we bare, socially and economically, restriction of crypto?
- national gov constraints?
- are backdoors possible / feasible?
- limit gov crypto research and academic collab?
- any crypto limits possible or sensible when "everyone codes"?
- ICT colonies - can we effect any real position re crypto?
