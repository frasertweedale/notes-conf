Michael Sutton, CISO, Zscaler Inc.

- We can't look for bad stuff expecting it to look like bad stuff

- A crowd of thousands of people, and one bad guy who looks like
  all the others.  Good luck!

- Don't believe the hype


Encryption: privacy vs security:

- double edge sword for enterprise security
- 25% of Zscaler customers block unscannable files (e.g. PGP
  encrypted file)
- 32% of Zscaler customers block password protected files
  - Could contain malware... send password separately ->
    bypass security.
- SSL inspection has performance cost on security applicances
- 43% of all web traffic is SSL encrypted
  - harder to detect malware if it comes in over TLS
  - 38% of malware delivered over SSL (often hosted on dropbox,
    google, etc)
- 63% of Zscaler customers decrypt some SSL traffic

Ransomware:

- Lots of hands up when room asked "who has dealt with ransomware in
  your organisation"
- Speaker anecdote that AU seems particularly susceptible
- Ransomware is going corporate
- Defenses:
  - Sandboxing
  - Properly back up your data!

Trusted partner attacks:

- Go after service provider or contractor to get at high value
  target
- You must care about security of parters

Mobile:

- Android malware is almost all from 3rd party app stores


Questions:

Root cert delivery initiatives?

- You need to do it - Zscaler leaves you in control of how you do
  it.
