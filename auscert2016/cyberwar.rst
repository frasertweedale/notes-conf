Cyber(war) what is it good for?
===============================

Edward Farrell, Mercury Information Security Services

What is *cyber*?

- if it's computer networks, why don't we call it that?
- the absense of clear, common definitions causes problems

What's wrong with using "cyber"?

- etymology
  - heavy foundation in '80s sci fi
  - faded away during '90s
  - now it's come back but only related to security and defence
- the disconnect
- use by leadership and .mil space
- continued use
- specific terminology creates achievable outcomes
  - why "cyber pen testing" not "application pen testing"
  - why "cyber forensics" not "digital forensics"
  - why "cyber defence" not "computer network defence"

Pontification of cyber:

- the problem with leadership-centric approaches
- the "I'm on technical âˆ´..." approach
- social biases for no prior learning

Conclusions

- do we define cyber?
- in mil context, mil approach doesn't seem appropriate, but what is?
- overly technical or leadersihp dependent strats doomed to fail
- there are innovative paths out there; let's hack around a bit...
