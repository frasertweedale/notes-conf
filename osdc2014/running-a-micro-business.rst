Running a micro-business: a reprise
===================================

Perl Training Australia

- starting a small, product-specific training business in australia
- big business want to hire other big businesses
- large training companies create lock-in via training credits
- provided a good service, word got around
- eventually big training provides wanted to work with us
  - training under big brand
- occasional crazy schedules
- typically 1-2wk training per month
- 60hrs a week is crazy, but it was pretty awesome
- learned:
  - marketing
  - edu course development
  - client management
  - so much more

- Lots of work from home (obviously not the training)
- largely in control of what work taken on and when worked on
- interact with a huge slice of Australian IT professionals

- factoid: 50% of perl devs were programming on Windows
- qantas used to use perl to print boarding passes
- bcc was largest local govt client
- AGD was largest client ever

- went to conferences
  - confs and user groups was marketing

Drawbacks:

- a lot of skills stagnated
  - doing same things every day
  - no incentive to take on new kinds of projects
  - didn't even notice it happening

- stress
  - everything, always your resonsibility
  - couldn't be sick
  - juggle everything
    - you can take monday off, but clients are still going to call
      on mondays.
    - you're never actually off
  - at whim of training facility providers

- working in a home office can be socially isolating

Change:

- resign perl training australia; take a 9--5 job
- not responsible for marketing, no broad planning, not responsible
  for much at all.
- great colleagues who i enjoy working with
- sick leave
- learning new things regularly
  - frequently out of comfort zone

- challenge to go from flexible lifestyle to regular working hours
- commute
- only using a narrow portion of skills
  - no technical writing, business administration, client
    management, course development
- external pressure to *not excel* and deliver "good enough"
  quickly.
- don't get to control what I'm working on
- business not interested in confs âˆ´ on own time/dime
- can fire difficult clients but can't fire difficult colleagues

*Running your own business is a hell of a ride.*
