Jaap van Till:

- nothing is standalone anymore, even light bulbs, cars.
- 6.5bn ppl with phone
- 3bn ppl with internet, & growing
- people have no clue what's behind the screens
  - a problem in safeguarding infrastructure

Distruptive innovation:

- DIY; no permission needed
- A lot of ppl thought they had it made; then the next wave came.

Golden ages and crashes:

- last crash was '30s; huge growth in industry then boom.
- industrial age based on chemical and electromechanical technology
  is griding to a halt.
- next golden age is based on ICT
- a lot of things have to be reorganised/changed.

Mega-trends:

- PC
  - 1bn
- Smartphones
  - 6bn
- IoT emerging as the next megatrend
  - 28bn devices by 2020

Business models:

- telco exchanges are obsolete
  - packet routing and centralised directories (DNS)
- banks
  - do they do something useful?
  - can we do it ourselves?
- airlines
  - planes all computers.  less required of pilots.  airline is not
    a reservation system.

- Sharing is the new *having*.

The Trias Inernetica:

- Civil society
  - Empowered civilians
  - Volunteer
- Governments
  - long time; general interest of public
- Businesses
- Too much focus on gov, business.  Policy makers forget the third
  pillar.
- Needs to be decided where each task / societal need should belong.
  - Enterprises who take risks; make money when they succeed
