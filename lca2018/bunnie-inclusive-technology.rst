Making tech more inclusive through papercraft and sound
=======================================================

Why should we care?
- everyone benefits
- open source derives its power through inclusiveness
- "everyone" is a very small (<1%), elite group with narrow
  demographics
- what is the "XScreensaver" time bomb popped up on every
  politician's mobile phone

A lawmaker-ish proposal: "mission-critical code developers must be
bonded" (like locksmiths)

- sound preposterous but never say never!

- the MAJORITY of people have POOR computer skills
- even today, in many first-world countries ~20% of people cannot
  use computers!

- without inclusiveness, open source is politically powerless

- optimise efforts: look for obvious issues
  - gender diversity
  - maybe the bias is cultural
    - in China, there's much better gender balance
  - carnegie-mellon case study: <10% to >40% women intake in 5y.

- CS unique in assuming you already know it, before you study it
  - medical programs don't expect that you've performed surgery
  - law doesn't assume you been to trial
  - CS programs often assume you've written complex programs

- gender bias starts at a young age
  - the way things are marketed, the way we teach things, etc

- how to address
  - greater emph on contextualising CS
  - greater diversity of courses
  - smoother on-ramp

- can we change the approach to building electronics change the
  culture around it?
  - instead of breadboards, what about paper?

- paper electronics
  - a circuit constructed on paper or paper-like substrate
    - cardboard, fabric, etc
  - conductors often drawn on
  - components soldered on or stuck down with tape

- why do i like paper electronics?
  - circuitboard is topologically & electrically closer to paper
    than a breadboard

- paper vs breadboard
  - compat with SMT & through-hole vs through-hole only
  - natively supports comments vs nope
  - thin, flat light, foldable into 3d shapes vs fixed
  - cheap substrate vs not
  - may require soldering vs no soldering required
  - components typically no-reusable vs reusability

- rapid prototyping

- copper tape heat sink.  (can't do that on a breadboard!)

- RF directional couplers
  - copper tape ground plane on back
  - 4x 125MHz 100-Ohm impedance diff pair on red layer

- key barrier to mass adoption of paper electronics
  - through-hole components require soldering
  - SMT components are small and fussy

- Scaling up paper electronics!
  - circuit stickers
  - polyimide flex PCB + Z-tape
  - stickerable, solder-free format
  - paper-compatible

- Circuit Stickers (Crowd Supply)
  - $100k; an "accidental start-up"

- defining the soul of the company
  - not "pinked-out" tech
  - not watering-down tech
  - are rigorous tech that's fun
  - philosophy that recognises tech & design are equal
  - balanced, multi-discipline team.  more women than men
  - vibrant community with many supporters

- currently buyers are 78% women
  - now they want to increase the men buying so it is more balanced!

- gender ration of contributors: ~50% women

- Love to Code
  - how to make coding more inclusive through paper electronics
  - chibitronics: https://chibitronics.myshopify.com/collections

- paper is also an expressive material
  - as well as technical

- principles of inclusiveness: balance, familiarity, simplicity

- challenge: find a universal interface for programming a
  microcontroller
  - serial, USB, ... is bad

  - case study: sound has universal interface & ubiquitous support,
    including in browsers

  - PROGRAMMING USING SOUND!  amaze

- Everything is open source.
  - the book is free to download and mix
  - get.chibitronics.com/ltc-vol1.pdf
  - github.com/chibitronics
  - microcontroller runs chibiOS

- "patience of a child" constraint
  - a child loses interest in ~5s
  - goal: average binary size ~1k

- LTC is not just for kids
  - extends from novice to startup
  - multithreading in introductory curriculum

- choose widely available components (so it can be produced not just
  in china but also US)

Take aways:

- sharing code is just the first step of inclusiveness
- it's not about commit and forget; it's pull, merge, fork
  - accepting new ideas and improving the codebase

- distribution in ANZ finally recovering from a very difficult
  engagement with iWorld

- Q: how old is youngest user?
