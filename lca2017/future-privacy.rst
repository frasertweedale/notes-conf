Future Privacy
==============

Michael Cordover

History:

- right to privacy is recent legal history
  - late 19th century: right to be left alone (solitude)
  - personal papers (secrecy)

- tech caused a shift
  - anonymity
  - right to be forgotten

Where the law went wrong

- big change is hard
- tech is hard
- names aren't that important
  - about identifiers, not names
  - not necessarily "who you are, legally".  might be, "who you are,
    reputationally"

Some of the law's greatest mistakes:

- do you consent?
- when?
- to what?
- you can't understand what's going to happen until you visit a website
  - by the time you're there, you've already exchanged a bunch of
    HTTP headers at minimum
- the idea of people making a rational tradeoff when they decide
  whether to visit a site / use a service is not reflected in the
  real world.

- it's not possible to provide a sufficient level of detail in a
  privacy policy
  - every seen "your personal data will be fed into a neural network
    to build a model for your likes and dislikes" in a privacy
    policy?

- app installation: provide the requested permissions first (when
  you install the app), *then* you can run it and find out what
  their privacy policy says.

- google location services: I have it turned on, *knowing what I'm
  trading off*.  My mother turned it on, but she didn't.  That is
  the case for the vast majoriy.

- If I took my phone to the doctor, Google can infer my health
  history.

- This is just the stuff we see.
  - lots of orgs aggregate anonymous or semi-anonymous data and
    build profiles for advertising purposes
  - linking identities across devices
  - even if only used for benevolent purposes, this is *per se* an
    interference with the person

  - and this is just non-state actors!
  - govt-independent infra is really hard
  - nobody is immune to law
  - govts demanding right to surveil everyone all the time


What do we do? / How are we going to solve the problem?

- I proposed the talk 6mths ago, and on Monday I came with an
  answer.
  - And on Tuesday I heard Pia's talk and had to change my answer

- force ppl to own their own data
  - hard to get ppl to host their own data
    - effort, technical skills required
    - easier to use remote services (where you don't control the
      data), even at $$$ cost
  - email it to them?
  - be bitcoin?

- open systems
- decentralisation
- federation
- non-permissive by default (forall x. x â†’ explicit consent given)

What sites do is way too much

- do one thing and do it well
- what that means:
  - ban google analytics
  - ban facebook
  - stop doing digital by default
  - go back twenty years and don't build the web
- but we've already made the choices
- the right to freedom from interference goes out the window with
  the web
  - you have to enable JS, you have to enable 3rd party cookies
  - services still get to use your data in creepy ways

- people aren't interested
  - they don't see or understand the cost
  - they don't see the benefit
- changing behavious of general public seems insurmountable
- I don't know how to do it.  Sorry.  Talk ends.


Questions
---------

- provision of privacy as a service is *not* the same thing as
  respect for the right to privacy

- the law provides that you should only collect what you need to
  provide a service.  The law is not clear on what this means in a
  technical context.
  - people are thinking about these things piecemeal.  the danger is
    in collection of bulk information.
