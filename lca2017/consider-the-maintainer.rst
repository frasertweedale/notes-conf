Consider the Maintainer
=======================

Nadia Eghbal @nayafia

- Is it alright to boil a sentient creature alive just for our
  gustatory pleasure?

- Is it alright if a project stuggles or dies because the maintainer
  can't keep up with it anymore?

- Is it alright to compromise or even deliberately ignore the
  happiness of maintainers so that we can enjoy free and open source
  software?

Symptoms

- More people using free software than ever before

- 2/3 of top github projects are maintained by one or two people

- 100x growth in users, number of maintainers per project static

- 100% of maintainers are expected to respond to every issue

- more users and contributes does bring more work for maintainer
  - does not scale like other kinds of production

- anecdote: ~80% of contributors don't know how to resolve a merge
  conflict

- maintainers often face this issues alone

- we're helping people to open their first PR but not helping
  maintainers triage issues

- why aren't we talking about this?

History:

- Free software was not designed with popularity in mind
  - unconcerned with being popular
- *Debian Social Contract* completely user-oriented
- "Open Source" label intended to convince corporate world to adopt
- both free software and open source are oriented around the user,
  not the producer

Four freedoms of software production:

- decide who participates in the project
- say no to contribs or requests
- define the priorities and policies of the project
- step down or move on, temporarily or permanently

Other things maintainers need help with:

- community best practices
- project analytics
  - maintainers should have the right to measure user behaviour
- tools and bots
- conveying support status
- finding funding
- existential questions
  - what does it mean to be a maintainer?
  - taking vacation

- we make Linux the example of open source viability.  what about
  all the other projects?
  - when the only mainstream story about the success of open source
    is linux, we sweep the concerns of the all the other projects
    under the rug.

- David Foster Wallace still ate the lobster, but that didn't stop
  him worrying about it.

Questions
---------

- what do you see is responsibility and potential of GitHub to set
  expectations?
  - give maintainers and power users a direct line of feedback to GH
    - they need to know they are heard

- getting better metrics?  How do you know if a project is just a
  personal experiement or actually important?
  - "stars" is not a good measure
  - measure reverse dependencies?
  - libraries.io is an interesting effort
