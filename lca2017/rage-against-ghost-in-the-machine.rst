Rage against the Ghost in the Machine
=====================================

Lilly Ryan

- What is a Ghost?
- "Ghost in the Machine"
  - human body is the machine, human spirit is the ghost.  different
    things.
  - "body and mind are separate"; 17th century thought

- the mind has historically been a private place
- privacy of thought != physical privacy
  - but the lines are blurring
- the way we interact with information is beginning to eliminate the
  line between the psychological and the social
- tech companies are starting to see parts of our mind
  - even if the conclusions are sometimes incorrect
    - e.g.: can't tell difference between someone writing a murder
      mystery, or someone planning a murder
  - your inner thoughts are not necessarily so private anymore
  - if you can understand the way someone things, you can pretend to
    be them.

3 stages of ghost hunting:

- summoning
- capturing
- banishing

summoning:

- digital recreation of personality by a bot or other artificial
  machine.
  - socmed, metadata, trails of clicks, etc.
  - reveal individual views and preferences even if they weren't
    intentionally expressed.
- ecto-metadata
  - what you get when you take metadata from your life, and spin it
    up externally to your identity
  - smartphone generates a lot of data for this!
- future bots will be a lot more realistic than current bots
  - e.g. more accurate responses to emergent events

capturing:

- chatbots: have conversations; behave like you do/did.
- talk to yourself.
- pair programming with yourself?
- put ghosts to work
  - reusing existing personality will be cheaper than creating AI
    from scratch
  - companies might own the bot they derive from your data (which
    they also own, because you agreed to ToS)
- the criminal spectrum
  - data is a gift to criminals as well as advertisers
  - data breaches
  - holding your host hostage

banishing

- restrict the amount of metadata you generate
  - easiest way: don't use the Internet
  - anonymity
    - has become more difficult
  - block cookies (there are lots of browser plugins)
  - don't share location data
  - VPNs
  - get involved in lawmaking process
