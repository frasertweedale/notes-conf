Why haven't you licensed your project?
======================================

Richard Fontana <fontana@sharpeleven.org>

- do you have code without a license cropping up in your projects?
- rise of GitHub
- "post open-source software": fuck the license and governence, just
  commit to GitHub.
- lack of license is now commonplace in recent/active projects
- % of repos licensed (GitHub): < 20% (2015)
  - probably a crude methodology
- anecdotally, there are a lot of unlicensed repos

- Berne convention
  - automatic copyright, no formality

- if POSS is ARR, why should free software advocates care?
  - the code with no explicit license is occurring in environments
    where explicit licensing / free software license is expected
  - from legal risk perspective, this is dangerous
- if assumption is that it is a naive attempt at free software (a
  common assumption, maybe valid) or dev is lazy, then the risk of
  copyright infringement is low (but nonzero)
  - and legal risk is also nonzero for an explicitly licensed repo

Implied copyright license

- reasonable expectation that copyright holder intends work to be
  used for a given purpose
- GitHub: no explicit license == ARR, subject to ToS
- doctrine of implied copyright license exists in many jurisdictions

  "The current way tech companies are grown promotes attitude of
  exploiting open source rather than contributing... Companies are
  going to have to pay from now on." - Zed Shaw

- Maybe devs are doing this deliberately to signal lack of
  permission
  - there's no evidence of this

- Pushing back against the permission culture
- devs growing up in a world where they believe sharing and
  permissiveness should be the default
  - by not including the license they signal that they reject the
    idea of copyright
  - this could be true for many developers

- Copyright license minimalism movement
  - MIT (<1999)
  - WTFPL (2004)
  - BOLA (2007)
  - CC0 (2009)
  - Unlicense (2010)
  - zero-clause BSD (2015)

- treatment of notices, pre-Berne, US
  - 1909 Act: publication without notice -> automatically public domain
  - 1976 Act: automatic copyright
  - 1978 - 1989-02-28: publicatoin without notice -> public domain
    unless effort to correct within 5 years.
  - ergo, tradition of publishing unlicensed code implying PD

How to solve?

- GitHub took a developer education approach, and made it easy to
  choose a license
  - political bias built in?
    - GH execs: put everything except secret sauce under MIT
    - they were coming out of non-copyleft culture and that was
      clear in several of the things they were doing
- write anti-permission-culture licenses
  - license contains political manifesto
  - might be part of the appeal of the unlicense
- raise issues to properly license the code
  - you can influence the license choice
