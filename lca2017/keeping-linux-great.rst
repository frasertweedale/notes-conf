Keeping Linux Great
===================

Robert Lefkovitz @r0ml

1. FLOSS is yesterday's gravy; therefore we should...
2. build small pieces on an expanding base (lithification)
3. so we can have free *running* software (app freedom)
4. because what we really want is *end user development*

- If people thinks that "app" and "software" are two different
  things, then that's the reality we must deal with
  - a question: is linux an "app"?

2. Lithification

- small pieces getting compressed into a solid base
- "all programs expand until they can send mail"

What should you do?

- vendor all your dependencies

3. App freedom

- Bret Victor: "advanced prog envs conflate runtime w/ devtime"

- Of course, OOP didn't work out, and it's another legacy we're
  stuck with.

- Freedom 0 (run prog for any purpose)
  - You are not running the software!  It's running somewhere else,
    on somebody else's computer.
  - Instead of their code on their computer, you want to run YOUR
    code on THEIR computer.
  - You want to be able to modify the code running elsewhere, if
    it's not what you want
- Freedom 3: access to the **runtime environment** is required,
  not just access to the source code


4. End user development

- what's the most successful programming environment in history?
  - Lotus 123?
  - MS excel?
- why?
  - there's no source code / program / data separation.  It's all in
    there!

- "customisation" is rarely end-user development in the way that the
  free software movement models

- as "data" and "program" merge together, the traditional concerns
  of free software movement become less relevant

"Liberal software"
