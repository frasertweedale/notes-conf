Disrupting the Classroom in a Good Way
======================================

What do we do?

- Enabling students with hands-on projects
  - most kids are visual
  - many kids learn through tactile, kinaesthetic means
  - direct feedback
- Projects, not just an experience
- Entire classes; no preselection
  - inclusive
  - also do extension programms
  - ICP (individual curriculum plan)

Some of the stuff we do:

- robotics (Mirobot)
- soldering (Mirobot)
- programming
- orienteering
- digital and analog electronics
- 3d printers and 3d printing
- brewing ginger beer
- history, archaeology, geography

Teaching programming by treating instructor as robot; students must
make it walk.  Minimal instruction set, e.g. "Move hip / knee by
angle theta".

Curriculum integration:

- teachers are busy
  - mostly non-specialised in primary schools
  - suitable resources
  - professional development
- new topics need attention
  - political and media forces on focus
- assessment
  - cross-curricular projects *can* be done
  - each aspect / question must be mapped back to a particular subject
- Integrate with existing subjects:
  - programming -> maths
  - robotics -> science
  - orienteering -> HPE
  - 3d printers / printing -> maths + science + design tech

Open tools - why?

- cost
  - schools inevitably have limited budget
  - enabling beyond school environment
  - hardware: diverse sources for kits and components
  - single vendor platforms hinder including new stuff
    - Adruino rather than Lego

- learn concepts and skills, not products

OpenSTEM vision / approach

- "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistingiushable from
  magic"
- Explore how and why things work
  - when you learn how a magician's trick works, it's still cool.
- Broad exposure to different things
- Implicit inoculation (against silly comments)
- Offline options - why?
  - password fatigue
  - some schools have dreadful internet connection

Australian Curriculum Digital Technologies

- ACARA draft recently approved by Minister
- P-8 mandatory; elective in 9-10
- programming from year 3-4; more in 5-6
