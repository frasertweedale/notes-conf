Whatever happened to Second Life and who cares?

What is Second Life?

- Metaverse (Snow Crash)
- Neverwinter Nights (2006); custom user-generated content
- Game-based learning (James Paul Jean)
  - Using existing games for learning activities
- Second Life hype
  - USD millionaire SL real estate agent

2007

- Camper
  - Paid to sit in a shoebox casino
- Landowner
  - Land rush was on; boom and bust on the wild frontier
  - SL make money from "land use fees."
- Builder
  - Beach houses, air terminals in the sky, shoes
- Rapper
  - What, don't I look like one?

2008

- Educator
  - Oh yeah, that's my day job!
- What could we do wit hthis thing?
  - Milgram and Zimbardo? (obedience experiment)
- Applied authentic language learning!
  - Now here was cause for some hype
- SVECTAT
  - Can't get published without a catchy acronym
  - *Shared Virtual Environment Complementing Task Achievement Training*

2009

- Branching out
  - Still wanting to see more of SL - with a new avatar
- Fateful meetings
  - Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy
- Curse of the Pharaohs
  - Tier + time zones + text = drama
- Into the Black
  - They can't take the sky from me

2010

- Getting too old for this
  - Cold turkey on the drama
- But why not turn it into research?

2013

- Just when I thought I was out...
  - They pulled me back in: Virtual Harlem
- Upping my game
  - Learning new skills, and being paid for it (NTNU; Taiwan)
- A bit more SVECTAT
  - Testing in two countries


What made second life interesting?

- Frontier spirit
- Objects, images, sounds, animations, scripts all by users
- IBM "metaverse" joint venture
- 2008: first "grid-to-grid" teleport (between SL and IBM)
- 2010 - 3rd party clients proliferate
- 2012 - NPCs, mesh, normal and specular mapping

What made is otherwise?

- Unilateral blunders and muddled retreats; no ears for "normal"
  users
- Arbitrary limits
- 2007: Ondrejka out; Voice; gambling ban
- 2008: Rosedale out; Kingdon gropes, chases Skype and Facebook
- 2009: Motto disappears, SL Marketplace, Zindra, lawsuits, Viewer 2
- 2010: Viewer 2 forced, all your content are belong to us, CEO
  chaos
- 2012: humble gamification; education discount debacle; widening of
  creator/user divide
- Bottom line: **Linden Lab don't know what their product is**

How I got involved in OpenSim

- FOSS version of SL server? Same clients? Count me in!
