Open Opportunities: Opening Up for a Better World
=================================================

Richard Tubb @richardtubb

- This year, GovHack events were held all across AU and NZ

- Open = Sharing
  - sharing the best ideas, methods and innovations with rest of
    world

- Be true to yourself
  - weigh up risk and reward
  - don't listen to naysayers

- Openness leads to opportunity

- Trust your "future self"

- Your future self is less interested in you, and more interested in
  the *impact* you have on others around you and the world.

- Unforseen opportunity

- Use your resources wisely
  - "yes" to levelling up; "no" to grinding

- *If you want to fast, go alone.  If you want to go fast, go together.*
