EasyCount: Freedom of Information and Openness
==============================================

Michael Cordover @mjec

Who am I?

- Lawyer
- I am not *your* lawyer (but I could be)
- I run one EC2 micro instance

Open government:

- open data
- CC licenses
- Open Government Partnership (OGP)
- Hack days / GovHack

This talk is about when gov *doesn't* release information.

Paper is sometimes good

- secure
- impossible to hack
- easy to monitor

Sometimes it isn't

- single transferrable vote
- hundreds of counts
- fixed point precision
- huuuuge senate ballots

What is a document

- in FOI act, definition is really broad
- if information is in it, it's going to be a document

- there was precedent in AU and O/S of *trying* to force release of
  databases or software
  - MySchool database
  - Cyber safety button source code
    - Govt didn't actually get it from contractor

Easy count request and response

- 4 Oct 2013
  - No
- Internal review
  - No (C&P)
- 58 documents identified but would not even provide list
- Everything in scanned PDFs
  - Asked for more reasonable format
    - "Nope; we have fulfilled obligations under Act"
- Matthew Landauer's request
  - Put in request for Word version of refusal letter

Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)

- OAIC closure forced AAT path
- AAT is essentially a court
- $861 application fee
- transcripts
- witness costs
- access charges
- Pozible campaign
- Launch 11:40
- Funded 13:20
- $2 to $2000
- 213 supporters
- $10,330 raised

List of documents

- Requested list of Documents
- AEC on 4th July 2014 applied to Australian Information
  Commissioner to have you declared vexatious
- Commissioner ruled in favour of Mr Cordover (respondent)

Political interest

- Senate motion that minister table "the source code of the software
  by which sentate votes are counted"
- Special Minister of State refused
  - "Publication could leave the voting system open to hacking or
    manipulation"

Dr Andrew Tridgell cam on board as expert witness.

Main issues:

- What constitutes a document?
  - AEC contends that whole of source code is a single document
  - 10,000s of lines of code
  - Have discovered that it is written in C#
- Could the source code be used as a "roadmap" to develop competing
  product?
- Release source code is still subject to copyright
- Hearing was at end of July 2015

Quotes from presiding member *before arguments*:

- *I should not from the outset I have a limited understanding of
  computer software*

- *It's very difficult to protect computer software from being used
  as a roadmap to developing other software*

- *And, from my experience, that is almost impossible to deal with
  once a source code is divulged*

Quotes from AEC's witness:

- *Architecture of EasyCount is not well suited to unit testing*
- *none of the features may be considered [particularly complex or

  innovative] but the software itself is very, very sophisticated
  [in] its flexibility and its sophistication in terms of being able
  to handle multiple types of elections*

Quotes from Tridge

- *the structure is not magic in a piece of software*

- *to a competent software engineer it's mundane stuff*

- *i wouldn't bother my time reading through 270k lines of mundane
  code.  I would be better off spending that time writing a test
  suite for my own software and starting on the validation process*

- Comments about structuringing software being similar to
  structuring an essay.


So what's the outcome?

- Probably lost the argument about whether it's a single document or
  not.

  - it's probably fair that the AEC shouldn't have to make a
    separate decision on 3700 source files.

- Will we win?

  - Has been 11 weeks since supplementary arguments.

  - A good sign given the starting point.

  - All AEC needs to show is that they would lose $1; the public
    interest doesn't matter

- There may be good arguments for access to part of software used
  solely for Senate count.

- Could help put political pressure to free the software, esp. given
  such small revenue (10s of thousand) against high development cost
  ($900k).


End result in event of win:

- We would be able to read and validate the software, but not use
  it, extend it etc.

- The law is still outdated wrt technical issues
  - e.g. Electoral Act is astoundingly prescriptive when it comes to
    dealing with paper ballots, let there is no scrutiny of software
    counting

- Government transparency is important

- Product of government development should be open to citizens.

- The obstinance of AEC is so unreasonable, but sadly entirely
  within the law.
