Open Source in Government
=========================

Pia Waugh

- 15 years ago if you tried to have a reasonable discussion about
  open source you'd hear
  - security risk
  - no support
  - no business around it

- It is now at the point where people are saying:

  - *I don't feel comfortable doing this unless we can be confident
    that the code will be open source*

- Free software has now become normalised

- The people who are leaders in our community are fit be leaders
  *anywhere*

  - Open source makes us as people more effective and more awesome
    at what we do, whatever it is

- Over last 20 year the shift has been from black box IT to more
  informed discussions

  - There is still a lot of people outsourcing even *thinking about*
    IT but many now care about understanding it

    - They understand that if they don't have geeks in the room,
      they will fail

    - We now get respect; people want to engage with us

- Open source web technologies were probably the tipping point in
  adoption of free software in government

  - Govt departments are big, conservative and often stuck in their
    ways

  - The change of attitude is spreading

- Some people are still stuck on the idea that open source is a
  threat

  - But it's now not just the open source advocates who openly
    refute this

- There has always been open source in science agencies

  - But until ~10 years ago it was hidden

    - "of course we use it... but don't tell anybody"

  - NICTA OKlabs microkernel, Xena archival tool

- Maturity around secret principles

  - Security by obscurity used to be the norm

  - Now openness is seen as important

- Open source gives flexibility in Govt to create better services
  and better government

- Government procurement policy now explicitly requires agencies to
  evaluate free software

- *Learned helplessness* is common in government

  - After a speech on "collaborative innovation" one person asked
    *what are you going to do to help me collaborate*.  Really!

- The power to fork presents a sanity check that you're going in a
  good direction.

- GovHack is now heavily government supported (but still
  community-run)

  - Some departments now give time-in-lieu for their staff to go

  - Best PD they've ever had

  - Helps Govt realise isn't not king-in-the-castle, rather
    node-in-the-network

  - *maybe someone else can do this better than we can*

  - *maybe we can do this better if we work with others*

- Question: *how to encourage risk-averse departments*

  - *What's the risk of doing this* is often ask

  - *What's the risk of NOT doing this* is *not* often asked

  - Help them understand the *benefits*

  - It can be a long game; surround yourself with peers who will
    help you maintain the rage

- Question: a lot of govt data is crap to the point of being
  unusable.  What do to with this?

  - When we first started with open data, found that some agencies
    are good with data, most didn't have a clue.

  - One agency walked into room, put printed copy of annual report
    on desk and said *we already do open data; what's the problem?*

  - Original strategy:
    - 1. encourage publishing
    - 2. focus on quality
    - 3. focus on value realisation

  - There was a lot more work than expected to even get publishing
    happening at all

  - Agencies are starting to automate publishing

  - Three aspects:
    1. metadata (schema, discovery)
    2. data (format, quality, accuracy)
    3. API (ease of use, reliability)

  - A bunch of agencies want to publish on their own platforms

  - blog.data.gov.au (Dept of Prime Minister and Cabinet)
