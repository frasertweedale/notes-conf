Using FOSS for proposing improved public transport plans in Australian cities
=============================================================================

Transport planning

- a big, complicated subject
- VKT = "vehicle kilometres travelled"
- have we reached peak VKT?
  - we have levelled out, defying forecasts of linear growth

Software in transport planning

- original key transport models developed in 1950s
- often in time of expansion of freeway networks
  - thus constarined by "where do we put freeways"
- software now used in many ways

What can free software offer?

- "open science" inspired argument: building open source software to
  document assumptions is necessary part of scientific progress
- open gov: transparency of tools and data, contestability of
  assumptions.
- pluralism and inclusive society: open source and open data support
  people developing alternative proposals to promote their views

Project collaborators in [speaker's] research:

- Beyond Zero Emissions
  - National NGO, Melb based
  - "facilitate a timely transition to zero carbon future"

- Public Transport Users' Association (PTUA)
  - Victorian NGO formed in 1984
  - broadly represents interests of PT usres
  - paid memberships

BZE project aims / goals:

- HSR feasibility study
- wanted to look at model of intra-city transport; redesigining MEL
  to move ICE passenger travel to public transit.

Multimodal networks:

- public transport for a big city can be more effective than it
  usually is
- modes may not cooperate well together
- (lack of) integrated ticketing system
- radial topology preventing "lateral" movement

Standards:

- OGC - Open Geospatial Corsortium
- OpenStreetMap
- GTFS developers.google.com/transit/ (timetable)

Creating a GTFS timetable:

- google-supported transitfeed library

OpenTripPlanner (OTP) demo.

- Isochrone colouring
- Batch mode
- RESTful API

QGIS example

Calculating operational requirements

Lessons learned; relections:

- Developed a GIS analysis platform that could illustrate issues for
  both organisations
- However, neither as yet played a large role in advocacy campaigns
  to the public
- But they do hopefully help expand the "range of the possible"
  among activist groups

Using free software in NGOs

- bringing Free software culture to small org can be challenging
  - non-profits often receive proprietary software gratis

- supporting NGOs to build towards long-term FOSS and GIS a good &
  important complement to hackathons?
  - several overseas models exist for this

- understandable; these orgs have multiple goals with limited time

Bigger picture

- what we did is still a long way from opening up the main transport
  modelling process
