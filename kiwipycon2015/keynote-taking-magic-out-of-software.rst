Taking the magic out of software
================================

Katie Bell, GrokLearning, ex-Google

- computers are stupid
- computers require precision
- programs respond to different input
- avoid unnecessary repetition
- data needs to have structure

- "Coding is the new literacy" <- complete crap
- Coding is the new biology
  - start in primary school
  - make sense of the world around you
  - be able to reason about it
  - understanding how a computer works is fundamental to using them
    efficiently, making good decisions
  - bonus points: inclusivity.  every single child will have the
    opportunity to find out if it's something they're interested in


Coding curriculum
-----------------

UK curriculum:

- 5-6yo: algorithms and computational thinking,
  creating/storing/retrieving data
- 7-11yo: creating and debugging programs, sequence, selection and
  repetition, how networks and the internet work
- 11-14yo: two languages (at least one text-based), boolean logic,
  hardware, software and how computers work, how data is is
  represented in binary

AUS curriculum:

- F-2: describing algorithms, identify digital systems, collect data
- 3-4: visual programming (user input, branching), representing data
  i ndifferent ways, explore systems for transmitting data
- 5-6: visual programming (iteration), whole numbers as a basis for
  representing al ltypes of data, using networks to transmit data
- 7-8: general purpose language (functions), text, image and audio
  data in binary

- Curriculum is langauge-independent

Different kids get excited about different things:

- algorithmic problem solving
- how stuff works
- building cool stuff

- Python is not good at building software like what you use on your
  desktop
- You can do web things BUT: HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, JavaScript <-
  too many things to teach/learn!
- Requests from kids and teachers: "how do I make an app like flappy
  bird", "kids need something visually engaging", "how do I send
  this game to my friends?"

Hard problems:

- build better python IDE
- simple and powerful GUI toolkit (bonus points for drag+drop)
- make python apps work on mobile
- bonus points: is anyone taching 3d animation scripting?

If these are too hard:

- Advocates for coding in schools
- Train teachers, not kids
- Run workshops in your local school
- Become a teacher

Questions
=========

- How do you fund all this?
  - National Computer Science School (summer camp run by USyd)
  - GrokLearning is a tiny for-profit company; we charge a small
    amount ($20 per student) for online course

- Workshops in schools: too much red tape :(
  - Apart from background checks, all you should need is permission
    of school

- Hard to encourage teachers to learn new stuff.  How do we
  encourage them?
  - There's not a lot you can do... (same in all industries)
  - This is the problem that a mandated curriculum is designed to
    solve

- What is the use case of an IDE at all?
  - Some kids do get more engaged thru using command line

- IDE spec?
  - syntax highlight
  - show which line errors are on
  - show code running
  - be nice to use
