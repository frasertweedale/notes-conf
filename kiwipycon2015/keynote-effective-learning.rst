Effictive Learning
==================

- Dropbox desktop client is written almost entirely in python
- server also has a lot of python in it

- how to get the most effective learning experience possible, for
  adults and programmers

1. Mindset
2. Strategies

(intelligence) Growth mindset; Carol Dweck

- c.f. "fixed" mindset
- if you have fixed mindset, you might put in less effort
- "praise that backfires"
- "wow, you're really smart"
  - less likely to choose challenging problems after receiving praise
  - did significantly worse on subsequent problem sets
- also affects response to confusion
- programmers need a growth mindset
- does anyone believe in a fixed mindset?
  - it is fairly pervasive in tech industry and programming
  - "10x engineer"; were they born 10x or did they get there 1x at a
    time?
  - hero worship

Can you change a fixed mindset?

- heck yes
- identifying the fixed mindset:
  - "I am ..."
  - "Some people are just..."
- Reframe praise, success and failure
  - praise: "you must have worked really hard"
- Celebrate challenges
- ask about processes

Impostor syndrome

- the feeling that you are secretly a fraud who will be discovered
  at any moment
- confidence doesn't predict how you respond to failure
- if you're doing something new, confidence in doing something old
  doesn't help

Book: *Self-theories: their role in motivation, personality, and
development mindset*

Strategies

- mastery-oriented (growth mindset) people focus on strategies
- Book: *Make it Stick* Peter C. Brown et al.
- learning is an acquired skill and you can get better with practice
- findings:
  1. effortful retrieval > rereading
    - rereading -> *fluency illusion*
  2. spaced practice > massed practice
    - e.g. four 1hr sessions > one 4hr session
    - spaced; varied; interleaved
  3. difficulty is (usually) desirable
    - things that are hard to learn are more easily retained
    - not all difficulties are desirable, e.g. anxiety about
      performance

Implementing effortful retrieval

- always have an hypothesis and experiment when debugging
- check your understanding
- if cost of failure is low, take a guess!

Implementing spaced practice

- work on different kinds of problems
- side projects
- context switch does slow down immediate progress but is good for
  long-term success and productivity

Implementing difficulty

- there's plenty of difficult already in programming
- welcome small mistakes
