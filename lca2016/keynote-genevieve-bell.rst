Building the Future
===================

Genevieve Bell, Intel

"I know I'm home in Australia when I go to a conference that has a
raffle"

- What is the future going to be an what are the responsibilities we
  as technologists have in building the future?

- When I think about the future I think about it from the point of
  view of humans, not just technology.

- Hype curve in three words: "Yay!", "Hmm", "Hrrm"


Connectivity:

- Technology functions best when it is constantly connected
- Humans function best when we are intermittently disconnected
- As human beings, "seamlessly connected" isn't good for us.
  - context matters tremendously
  - if you only have one email address, you are in fact weird,
    statistically


IOT:

- 50bn connected devices
- there are many "hidden" domestic habits that IoT suddenly makes
  known
- the word commonly used is "gossip", i.e. "is my house gossiping
  about me?"


Big data:

- Claim: "More data = more truth"
- Data doesn't necessarily equal truth in the first place
- It is more complicated than it appears
- The average human being tells six to two hundred lies today
- machines aren't always entirely accurate about what they're up to
  either


Algorithms:

- algorithms embed a set of assumptions about how the world works
- "recommendation" algorithms are a huge industry
  - always retrospective, never prospective
  - the choices you have are based on what you and others have
    *already done*
- autonomous vehicles: what happens when it knows sums insured when
  making decisions about who's gonna die?


Security

- biometrics
  - biggest hack of US Govt data was database of fingerprints
  - it's one thing to change your password; can't change your
    fingerprints
- security discussions are now intimately entwined with *national
  security* discussions
- the method of securing things is still, conceptually, a padlock.
  This doesn't scale.
- Book: Bruce Sterling, *The Epic Struggle of the Internet of Things*


Privacy

- regulatory framework is very complicated, varies by country
- you probably care less about the information itself and more about
  what information is learned when it's stitched back together, and
  what decisions are made based on the derived data
- there is a direct correlation between ikea flat-pack furniture
  purchase and emergency room admissions


Memory

- Save everything?
- Some technologies have the "benefit" that things just degrade
  - pencil and paper
  - floppy disks?
- What we want to be forgotten about?
- Data Retentions vs "The Right to be Forgotten"
  - how do you feel about forgotten in one place and intensely
    remembered in another?


Innovation

- or "disruption"; twinned ideas
- innovation is mostly accompanied by stories of vast utopian
  fantasies and vast dystopian fantasies
- what is being disrupted, to whose benefit, what inequities are
  being maintained / created?


Conclusion:

- we are the architects of our future
- we have a lot of responsibility to get it right
