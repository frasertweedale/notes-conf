Community 3.0
=============

- Thoughtful and productive communities makes us as a species better
- We need to build a bridge between atoms and bits

- Tangible value:
  - the stuff you can measure
  - you can track it, look at logs and metrics, determine if it's
    working for you
  - if it's not, you can drive the numbers in different directions by
    influencing things

- We are irrational
  - in fairly predictable ways

- system 1 thinking: "1 + 1 = ?"; "2"
- system 2 thinking
  - consequential reasoning


SCARF model:

- Status; clarify in relative importance
- Certainty; creading security and predictability
- Autonomy; creating intentional choices
- Relatedness; define clear social groupings
- Fairness; reducing unfair opportunity and rewards

Two golden rules:

- we accomplish our goals indirectly
- we influence behaviour with small actions

Community 3.0 =
  system 1 and 2 thinking
  + behaviourial patterns
  + workflow
  + experiences
  + packaged guidance
