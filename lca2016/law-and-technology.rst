Law and technology: impedence mismatch
======================================

Michael Cordover, practicing lawyer

Lawyers and politicians don't get it:

- governing behaviour that is not well understood is hard
- there is an idea that we should have fewer, more general law
  - that works sometimes, but not all the time (as we shall see)
- there's an implicit assumption that we won't enforce all the law,
  all of the time
  - pervasive surveillance changes this

Tech people don't get it either

- good reasons for complexity in law
- technology isn't neutral
  - and the tech community is not neutral
  - we need to be mindful of this

Legal detailed programmatic specificity

- there are examples of where the law is deeply technical, in the
  public interest
  - building codes
  - food
  - civil aviation
  - broadcasting
- where law is specific, we tend to end up with good outcomes
  - appropriately reflects what the law should be doing
- software could be interpreted as *a service* in Australian Consumer Law
  - conveyed under a revocable license

Something less obvious:

- *Privacy Act* on cross-border disclosure
- distinction between *use* and *disclosure*
- *use* of personal information overseas is not regulated
  - mere use is not *disclosure*

Something less obvious to government:

- analysis of "anonymous" data
  - name, photo, GUID

Hundreds of examples:

- encryption
- unauthorised access
- copyright
- evidence

An obvious, easy solution:

- everyone has to know about technology

Just make lots of contracts

- actually a whole branch of law: *private law*
- Copyright
  - has been very successful in protecting certain tech interest
  - GPL is the great revolution
- TOS
- EULAs
- P3P

Laws which are fit for purpose

- law must comprehend that ISP in not an IRC server
- VOIP isn't PSTN
- focus on the outcome, sometimes
- if we can make politicians understand that some technology is
  different from other technology, we might get fit-for-purpose laws
- complaint: "but we'll have to keep amending it"
  - parliament sits often enough to do that!
  - better than unintelligible / overbroad laws

A somewhat radical shift in legal approach:

- it turns out the interest is (sometimes) different
- *United States vs Causby* (1946)
  - "whoever owns the soil, it is there's all the way to heaven and
    hell"
  - Judge ruled that that idea has no place in the modern world
  - that's all it takes!

You can help!

- don't ignore the law
  - Being a tech person doesn't mean that you get to opt out of legal
    or political discussions.
  - comply with the law and make sure the law can be complied with;
    get a seat at the table
- don't be too technical
- don't expect a technical solution
- think about policy solutions
- talk to everyone
  - the most important thing is to have a seat at the table
- when all else fails, sue the government

Questions:

Why did the EasyVote appeal fail?

- was found to be a trade secret
- it didn't matter that there was a huge public interest
- it didn't matter that the revenue was vastly eclipsed by what it
  cost the make the software

Civil disobedience - what place does it have?

- As a lawyer I believe in the system and using the system to make
  changes
- Civil disobedience has been effective at changing the law in the
  past
- It might be a good thing to do if the law is actively harmful
  - As an extreme example, in Nazi Germany don't comply with the law
