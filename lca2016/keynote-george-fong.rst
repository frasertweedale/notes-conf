The Cavalry's not ocming... we are the Cavalry

The Challennges of the Changing Social Significance of the Nerd

George Fong, Internet Australia

- Talking about changing dynamics and responsibility of the technical
  community.

What drove the initial creation of the concept of the 'Net?

The growing importance of the Internet makes people in power want to
control it (when they don't even fully understand it).  This causes
civil society organisations great concern.

In Australia:

- The cloud has now become an effective marketing term for "the
  Internet"

- Technology choice has been described in politicial metaphors

- In Australia, if you mix tech and politics you are in trouble

- In this country, with very small population and very large
  landmass, the most important thing is the *reach* - to reach 100%
  of the population.

- We must continue to talk in plain English and we must talk to the
  people in power, in some form.

- Two-factor authentication, which sounds great, is actually a
  concession that the Internet's broken.

- RFC 1984: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1984

  *The IAB and IESG are therefore disturbed to note that various
  governments have actual or proposed policies on access to
  cryptographic technology that ...*

- Michael Cordover:

  *The law doesn't get technology.  Laws drafted with technical
  input end up to technical; laws drafted without technical input
  end up too broad*

  - That's exactly what happened with the "data retention"
    legislation

- RFC 7258: Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack


Rules for life:

- technical community does not live in a parallel universe
  - it is possible that the legal and political professions *may*
- human logic does not compute
- there is a difference between what should be and what is
  - you can influence the former but are forced to deal with the
    latter.

Not a fix:

- *Anonymous*
- Social media wars
- A seat at the table should always be the first objective

What *can* we do?

- not necessary for every tech person to become a sociologist,
  lawyer or politician
- it IS now necessary to factor in humanity and the impact of your
  work on the same
- collectives and NFPs can assist.  Use them and provide input and
  feedback

Final Thought: The cavalry is not coming.  You are the cavalry.  Act
accordingly.
