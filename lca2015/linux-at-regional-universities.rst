Linux at Three Regional Universities
====================================

Dr. Randy Appleton


Why do you care?
----------------

- reflective of what's going on generally
- reflective of the future


Which three?
------------

- Michigan northern peninsula
- Population less than Christchurch
- Michigan Tech[nological University]
  - 7k students; 1.3k grads
  - 200 CS majors
  - Lots of sysadmin majors
  - CS PhD program


Michigan Technological University
=================================

- 7k students; 1.3k grads
- 200 CS majors
- Lots of sysadmin majors
- CS PhD program
- Linux is used in several sysadmin courses such as Computer
  Networking
- Linux is main subj of two sysadmin courses
- Used in security course
- Researcher use Linux "a lot"
- Inactive LUG
- Lots of scripting languages taught (Perl, Python, etc)


Northern Michigan
=================

- Regional uni
- ~9k students
- Linux required for sophomore and senior network programming course
- Optional Linux sysadmin course
  - "app of the week" (Apache, NFS, email, etc)
  - Shell scripting at the end
  - Big project at the very end
      - Menu of things to set up for points
      - Lots of apps
      - Compile kernel
      - Write shell scripts
      - Beer offer
- Inactive LUG

Teaching linux sysadmin
=======================

- No problem picking distributions
- No problem picking topics
- Huge problem with disparate incoming knowledge
  - Let them pair up (but help the clueless)
  - Make sure it's not a one-carries-all situation
- Theory???
- Kernel hacking
  - Difficult to do
  - Difficult to teach
  - Best students did great, but you can't only teach to the best
    students

Lake Superior State
===================

- ~2.6 students
- ~70 CS majors (combined with Math)
- Budget cuts
- One professor who teaches Linux (sysadmin and PHP/MySQL)
- No LUG
- Not lots of research

What's Missing
==============

- Community colleges
  - Zero Linux
- High school
  - No Linux

Usage for projects
==================

When students do stuff, what do they pick?

- Robots with Arduino (linux)
- PHP/MySQL hosted on Linux
- Apps hosted on iOS or Android
  - Android and Linux are different things in minds of students
- Video games (never on linux)
- [check slides]

Infrastructure
==============

- Web sites (all of them)
- Beowulf clusters (all Linux)
- Some BSD

Obstacles
=========

- No usage in high schools
- Need to attract liberal studies students
- Uni will support Windows and Macs but not Linux
  - They have good reasons
  - They totally know Linux though
- Does not meed educational needs???
  - Is sysadmin a core concept?

What would make it better?
==========================

- Really, maybe it's OK?
  - Servers but not desktops might reflect real world usage?
- No, we don't need an edu-distro.
- A very easy compiler Visual C++/Java is pretty cool.
  - Easier than eclipse, better than Visual Studio
- Add system administration to CS core
- Money to go to PenguinCon
