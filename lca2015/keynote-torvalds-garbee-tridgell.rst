Why isn't FreedomBox ready yet?

- FreedomBox 0.3 release
  - Debian unstable tree
  - BeagleBone, Dreamplug, RasPi, Virtualbox
  - Major update to Plinth UI
  - Tor Hidden Services
  - Automatic firewall installation and operation

And Tridge short-circuits the inevitable Rusty Russell interruption
and invites him down to join the panel.

Trusted computing and signed code:

- Trusted computing is used "internally" for signing modules with
  one-time keys that are thrown away.  Noone can sneak anything into
  your kernel.
- Things have clearly changed; we do use it all the time.

Linus on IPv6:

- 12 years ago said it was "a decade away"
- Now says "it is still a decade away"
- "If your shoes do want an IP address, maybe you should give them
  one from your private IPv4 address space"

Why aren't you nice?

- "The most important part of open source is that you can do what
  you're good at"

Worrying trends: more hate, more abuse, more vitriol.  As a
professional this really concerns me.  I love my job and want to
love it in 20 years time, but if this trends continue I won't be in
the industry.  Can others on the panel respond?

Is it the year of the linux desktop yet?

How to get the younger generations into our community?

- Look for places where there's an intersection between simple
  computing devices and real-world effects and feedback loops.

Linus: what are you working on now that is not the kernel?

- Nothing

Documentation

- Rusty: "Effort put into documentation in the kernel was not paid
  back"

What DE?

- Tridge: "The closest thing to a desktop I have at the moment is
  GNU Screen"

- Tridge: "Processes for software development are becoming more and
  more mechanised."

Security bugs have always been found in Open Source, but in 2014
the way they have reached the world through the media has changed
dramatically.  What are you predictions for security in the open
source/Linux space for the next 12 mths?

- Linus: "If you knew which piece of code to look at for security
  issues, we wouldn't have security issues"
