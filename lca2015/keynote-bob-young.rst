- You need to find business people to partner with in your
  particular innovation.

- You don't sell *features* of your software to your customers; you
  sell the *benefits* of the software.

- We gave customers *control* of their technology.

- Your single biggest challenge as a business guy is to get the
  world to pay attention to you.

- Don't write a new license.  The act of forcing someone to read an
  unknown license will cause them not to do business with you.

- In free market democracies, the customer and the citizen are the
  same.  You can frequently solve social problems in the market.

- On regulation: you can't play football without referees; the one
  who cheats the most will win.

- There are businesses that do really well making the world a worse
  place.
