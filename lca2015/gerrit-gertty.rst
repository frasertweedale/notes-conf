Gerrit & Gertty: a daily habit
==============================

- Anita Kuno (anteaya)
- Member of OpenStack Infrastructure program
- Among top 50 reviewers for OpenStack
- Started during Grizzly release
- HP employee

Audience assumptions:

- understand value of code review
- recognise need to improve review throughput
- able to evaluate your behaviour and implement modifications

Why increase review throughput?

- Code review can become bottleneck for development
- Distribute the load with more reviewers
- Improve the code with diversity of reviewers

Habits
------

"An acquired behaviour pattern regularly followed until it has
become almost involuntary" - dictionary.com

- A habit contains no decision making process
- Anatomy: Cue -> Routine -> Reward
- Different from "addiction", which doesn't stop
- Cue: location, time, emotion, action, others
- Routine: what someone else would observe as the "Habit"
- Reward: the sense of completion
  - By selecting a tangible reward, code review becomes desirable

Establishing a habit
--------------------

- Routine filtering: isolate patterns to make a repeatable behaviour
  possible
- Identify a trigger:
  - location, time of day, emotional state, social needs, completion
    of another habit
- Construct a custom bugtracker query for finding candidate patches
  to review.

Gertty
------

- console interface to Gerrit
- available on PyPI
- has local database so good for offline work
- some folks like the console

Closing thoughts
----------------

- You can never remove a habit; you can only establish a more
  compelling habit on the same trigger.
- A habit won't stop until conclusion
  - Pick ways to acknowledge you are at the end
- Habits are not logical
- Once a habit is created, conscious thought is no longer involved.
