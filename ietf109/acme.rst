ACME WG
=======

Notes: https://codimd.ietf.org/notes-ietf-109-acme

- Mostly agree that discovery is a problem that needs solving and
  the ACME WG could be the place to do it.

- Richard Barnes: worry about the starting point.  Idea: leverage
  the domain of the identifier you want to validate as a starting
  point.

- There is interest in SRVName.  Needed for SIP, TURN too.
