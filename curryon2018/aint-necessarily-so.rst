It Ain't Necessarily So
=======================

Chris Ford, ThoughtWorks

Mezzo - haskell composition library by Dima Samoz
- *Haskell School of Expression*
- enforce rules of composition via dependent types
- "a very strict spell/grammar checker for music"
- Chopin's *Prelude* in Mezzo... there were a few notes
  that had to be left out âˆµ forbidden interval

Alternative

- "allowed or forbidden" is too restrictive
- types of expressions can encode a "degree of entropy/surprisingness"
- the latter is more faithful to the domain of music

conclusion

- innovative states might be unrepresentable
  - or unusual states might be unremarkable

- dependent types might help, but work needed

- Huron's *Sweet Anticipation* is really cool
